# Ex3

In this game, you can compete with friends to get the best score! 

First, you will need to download this project. Make sure to built the pathes to all the JARs!

Then, create the game by calling the constructor! On the screen, you will see a pop up window where you will choose the level you want. 
Each level is different - number of robots, the time limit, the road map. 
Then, choose if you want to manually move the robots or not. If you choose yes, click on the robot you want to move,
and then on the destination node. If there are more than one robot, you can move them simultaneously. 
If you chose 'no', the robots will move automatically to the closest fruit, and eat as many as they can. 

All this is a metaphor of a car nevigator that all he wants is to get as fast as he can to the destination point.
